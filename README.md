Dissent accountable anonymous group communication
Dissent builds on dining cryptographers and verifiable shuffle algorithms to offer provable anonymity guarantees, even in the face of traffic analysis attacks, of the kinds likely to be feasible for authoritarian governments and their state-controlled ISPs for example.
Dissent seeks to offer accountable anonymity, giving users strong guarantees of anonymity while also protecting online groups or forums from anonymous abuse such as spam, Sybil attacks, and sockpuppetry. Unlike other systems, Dissent can guarantee that each user of an online forum gets exactly one bandwidth share, one vote, or one pseudonym, which other users can block in the event of misbehavior.

In this paper, we describe Credence, a decentralized ob- ject reputation and ranking system for large-scale peer- to-peer filesharing networks. Credence counteracts pol- lution in these networks by allowing honest peers to as- sess the authenticity of online content through secure tabulation and management of endorsements from other peers. Our system enables peers to learn relationships even in the absence of direct observations or interac- tions through a novel, flow-based trust computation to discover trustworthy peers. We have deployed Credence as an overlay on top of the Gnutella filesharing network, with more than 10,000 downloads of our client software to date. We describe the system design, our experience with its deployment, and results from a long-term study of the trust network built by users. Data from the live de- ployment shows that Credenceâ€™s flow-based trust compu- tation enables users to avoid undesirable content. Honest Credence clients can identify three quarters of the decoys encountered when querying the Gnutella network.
